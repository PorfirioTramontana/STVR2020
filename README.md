A study has been carried out to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different GUI testing approaches in the context of Android apps, in order to better understand the effectiveness of Capture and Replay (C\&R) test-generation techniques in comparison with Automated Input Generation (AIG) techniques.

To this aim, 20 Computer Engineering students from the University of Naples “Federico II”.were enrolled in the Advanced Software Engineering course, held by one of the authors, for the Master degree in Computer Engineering.

The students, having university-level programming and software engineering skills, during the course received several lectures on testing techniques, testing automation, GUI testing, and C&R techniques. In addition, they received several lessons on Android programming (at the end of the course they had to develop an Android app) and were all Android phone users.
 
Two tasks were requested to each of them and for each of the four Android apps considered in the experiment:
 
UET : In the first task, each student had to produce test cases exploring the application under test while using the Capture and Replay tool called Robotium. The students had no previous knowledge of the applications under test. The Robotium tool automatically generates Android JUnit test cases corresponding to the recorded interactions.

IET : In the second task, the same students had to design further test cases with the aim to try to obtain the maximum obtainable coverage of the source code of the applications under test. They have the source code of the applications under test and the coverage achieved by the previously recorded tests.

The test cases produced by the 20 students are in the folder called Students.

The open source apps included in the experiment presented in the paper have been manually instrumented in order to allow the automatic measure of the source code branch coverage.

The source code of the instrumented source code cis in the folder called InstrumentedSourceCode
